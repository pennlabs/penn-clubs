If the actions button says "Manage", click this button to be redirected to manage your club page. If your club is not listed here, or the button says "Leave", it means you do not have officer status for your club on Penn Clubs. Please contact a member of your club who is an officer to grant you access by following [these steps](https://pennclubs.com/guides/fair#managingmembers), or by emailing contact@pennclubs.com with your PennKey and club name.
