    	Dear student group leaders,
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.2em">
        We have opened the student group registration process for the 2020-2021 academic year. To be
        considered an active student group on campus, the University requires all student organizations
        to be registered with the Office of Student Affairs. <b>This year, we have migrated our Student
        Groups platform from the previous system, G.O. Penn, to Penn Labs' platform, Penn Clubs.</b>
        All official registry of student groups will be handled through Penn Clubs.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.2em">
        <b>Please note a couple of important reminders regarding club information:</b>
        <ul style="font-size: 1.2em">
            <li>Student groups on campus may <b>NOT</b> use the word "UPenn" in their club names. Instead, we advise you to use "Penn" or "at the University of Pennsylvania".</li>
            <li>The Penn shield <b>CANNOT</b> be used in club logos, edited or unedited. Clubs with the Penn shield in their logos will not be approved for registration.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.2em">
        If you have already graduated, <b>PLEASE FORWARD THIS EMAIL</b> to the current leadership of
        the group so that they may complete the registration process. Instructions for transferring
        admin rights are included in this email as well.
    </p>
