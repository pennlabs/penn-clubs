    <h2>A Message to Penn Staff about Hub@Penn</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.2em">We are excited to launch the all-new <a href="https://hub.provost.upenn.edu/">Hub@Penn</a>
        platform to serve as a place for Penn students to find and connect with support resources. This platform comes at
        the request of Penn's senior administration and after close collaboration with NSOAI and the VPUL. We look forward
        to offering Hub@Penn as a resource for Penn students starting in advance of the Spring 2021 semester.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.2em">We are working diligently to ensure that as many appropriate Penn resources are invited to
        be a part of Hub@Penn as possible. In order to ensure the success of Hub@Penn, we need Penn resources to help
        populate critical information about the services they offer. Your office has been identified as an essential
        resource for the Penn community. As such, we invite you to follow the link below to fill out a form and make your
        resource visible on Hub@Penn.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.2em">To submit your resource, <b>fill out the <a
                href="https://hub.provost.upenn.edu/create">Hub@Penn Submission Form</a> by January 11</b>.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.2em">You have been designated to populate information for the following resource(s):</p>
    <ul>{% for resource in resources %}<li><b>{{ resource }}</b></li>{% endfor %}</ul>
    <p style="font-size: 1.2em">If there is another more appropriate contact to serve as the liaison between your resource
        and the Hub@Penn administrators, please feel free to forward this message and/or let us know who we should contact
        in future communications.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.2em">To account for rapid changes throughout 2020 and in preparation for the start of the Spring
        2021 semester, please feel welcome to provide general information about your office, directing students to your
        website for the most up-to-date information. Additionally, your listing on Hub@Penn can easily be updated as needed.
